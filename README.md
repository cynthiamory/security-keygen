## Description

The goal of this web application was to use the skills we learned for Javacript to create a password generator or security keygen based on a few factors.

These factors or criteria include the use of:
- Uppercase Letters (A-Z)
- Lower Case Letters (a-z)
- Number (0 - 9)
- Special Symbols (!@#$%...)
- Character count no less than 8 and no more than 128 in length.

The end user will select a Character Value. If the user selects a value outside of the given given criteria, they will be prompted that their selection is invalid and to enter another value. If the end user selects a value within the criteria, they will be prompted with a set of information that they can click ok or cancel out. If they click ok, the newly generated password will then be written in the textbox area and now they can copy/paste/save.
